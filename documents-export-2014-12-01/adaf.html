		<h2>The Social Justice Hub In Its First Year</h2>

	In 2009 a group of students broke into the construction site for the New School’s then-proposed University Center to protest against lack of student involvement in tuition and investment decisions. They chose to call themselves “the University in Exile” also the former name of the New School in the 1930s. From 2008 to 2011 the New School community organized 4/spell out numbers under 10 occupations of university buildings in protest of economic issues, student debt, and the school’s investments. All four times the specter of the school’s history of dissent and progressivism was used as a call for action. <br><br>
	        
	After the 2011 occupation, the New School’s Social Justice Committee, and President David Van Zandt agreed that there was a need for an area dedicated to social justice in the newly finished University Center building. The Social Justice Hub, as the space would be known, gave the Social Justice Committee and the groups associated with it a place of their own. Some now worry that with this designated area the activists of the school have lost the initiative to go out and actually act. <br><br>

	“They wanted a type of multifunctioning space that they could identify as a home base, where they could meet-up to do programming or be with like-minded people,” said Michael Joy, the Director of Campus Planning who helped designate the purpose of different spaces and facilities at the University Center.<br><br>
	
	The Social Justice Committee includes students, faculty, staff, and administrators from several divisions who work with the Provost’s office to address socioeconomic and cultural divisions of identity through policy and action. When the proposed University Center’s layout was shown to the student body at a 2012 town hall, the SJC asked President David Van Zandt for a space for the committee and the student clubs under its umbrella. They wanted a place that was specifically their own. The result was an area on the fifth floor of the new building called The Social Justice Hub. <br><br>
	
	Joy explained that after the 2011 protests it became apparent to Provost Tim Marshall and President Van Zandt that there was “an extreme need for the university to create a place for social action.”<br><br>
	
	Students have used the city and the urban campus as a place to organize for social justice activism for decades. Now with the creation of a SJH there is a concrete designated space for these activities. Some believe that the Hub has not helped to promote greater social activism at the university.<br><br>
	
	“We used to be known as the Marxists of the village, we were so hardcore into what we were doing,” said Petra Jarrar, 17-year-old sophomore at Lang and one of three students in The Social Justice Committee. “Nowadays I feel like it’s gotten a lot weaker.”<br><br>
	
	The whole school should be a social justice hub said Michael Joy. He did not see why student activism and social justice conversations had to be limited to a particular area.<br><br>
	
	“It doesn't feel like this place is a social justice space, it feels like it’s an extension from the study area,” said Cecilia Frescas-Ortiz a senior at Eugene Lang and Leader of The New School Dream Team, which meets every Tuesday at the Hub.<br><br>
	
	Frescas-Ortiz said that she is grateful there is a space intended for organizing and community building for social justice, but she finds the location of the space a major impediment for active conversation about sensitive issues.<br><br>
	
	On the other side two graduate fashion design classes neighboring the hub have now switched classrooms to no longer be next to the Hub. The classes complained that there was too much noise coming from the events hosted at the Hub. Teachers angry about lack of faculty offices have also cited the Hub as an area that could have been repurposed for offices. <br><br>
