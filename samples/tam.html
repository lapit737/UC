		<h2>The New School Wants You to Take the Stairs</h2>

<b>Google, Facebook, New School and Beyond </b><br><br>
Through heavy glass doors, past a large open vestibule, sits a commandeering staircase-
front and center. “Welcome to The New School: where we encourage you to take the stairs,” is

what the entrance to The New School’s new University Center (UC) seems to scream. The New

School wants you to take the stairs, but not for the reason you might think. Wondering where the

elevators went? They are purposely hidden away from the front doors off to the side of the

building. No this is not a health campaign and although the UC is one of the most sustainable

buildings in New York City, the reason for the prominence of these stairs and their landings is an

attempt to use open­plan design by New School designers and the architects at Skidmore,

Ownings, and Merill (SOM).

<br><br>

It’s not just The New School. From America’s top tech­companies use or are planning to

use open­plan design for their offices. Open plan design makes use of large accessible spaces

and does away with traditional, closed­door offices. It is meant to promote communication and

collaboration by literally breaking down walls. Even as more and more studies come out

disclaiming the benefits of open­plan design, companies like Google and Facebook seem to have

big plans for it.

<br><br>

“The open plan is meant to reflect an intention for open discourse,” Andrew Bernheimer,

Principal of Bernheimer Architecture and Assistant Professor and the Director of the Master of

Architecture program at Parsons said. He described his office, which makes use of open­plan

design, as a single room with a long communal table at which ten people work and collaborate.

“the driving concept was that we all collaborate and therefore an open plan without barriers would

foster conversation and critique,” he said.

<br><br>

Mark Zuckerberg’s plan for Facebook’s new offices is another attempt from Zuckerberg to

make the world “a more open place.” Designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, the Facebook

‘campus’ (designed to mimic a college campus) will be comprised of a single 10­acre room with

movable furniture. Once completed in 2016, the new office will be the largest open­plan office in

the world. Even with its seemingly lavish use of space, “it’s emphasis is on functionality, rather

than extravagance,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a project description.

<br><br>

Along with Facebook’s grand scheme, Google is also pioneering open­plan space design

with their project for a new building set to open in 2015 in Silicon Valley. In 2013, construction

began on the Bay View Addition to the Googleplex (google’s headquarters originally opened in

2006). The 1.1 million square foot project will be comprised of nine rectangular buildings

connected by bridges and surrounded by courtyards. The building is also supposed to promote

communication, with no employees being further than a two­minute walk away from each other.

<br><br>

The open­plan spaces at The New School are also meant to be collaborative spaces for

student, as collaboration is something that brands the school.

<br><br>

“While the work [at The New School] is sometimes (but not universally) collaborative, the

open plan is meant to promote visibility and similar discourse, between student and teacher and

between the students themselves,” Bernheimer said in regards to the New School’s use of open plan

<b>A Brief History of The Open Plan Office </b><br><br>
The first open­plan office was the Larkin Administration Building (built: 1906, demolished:

1950) in New York City, designed by modernist architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The design of the

building was based on a factory floor plan with very few walls. Workers were prohibited from

speaking — a far cry from today’s open­plan offices where the goal is to promote communication.

And while 20th­century bosses may have used open­plan design to closely supervise their

employees and assert power (by having their own separate offices), advocates say that more

recent open­plan offices enhance collaboration and break down hierarchies.

<br><br>

But some researchers disagree. Recent studies have found that open­plan offices may not

be as beneficial as previously thought. While the open space may promote more interaction,

communication, and the faster spread of ideas, critics say it may also be making workers sicker

and more prone to distraction.

<br><br>

“Personal control is strongly related to office employees' environmental satisfaction, as

well as perception of privacy and distraction,” according to a January 2014 study published in the

journal Ergonomics. Because of the high level of noise in open­plan offices, the study found that

distractions in open­plan offices had negative effects on the health and cognitive abilities of

employees.

<br><br>

People in open­plan offices also tend to take more sick leaves, according to a study in the

Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment and Health. The study found that offices set up in

open­plan reported 62 percent more sick days on average than single­occupancy offices. Two

explanations were offered: that viruses may spread more rapidly in open­plan offices, and that

stress induced by lack of privacy may cause a higher rate of sickness among employees.

<b>A New Kind of Campus </b><br><br>

But the designers of the University Center believe in the advantages of the open­plan

approach. “We used active design principles to encourage people to walk and interact more with

each other,” said Colin Koop, SOM’s senior design architect on the University Center project.

Koop named the staircases and landings as a way to “display the use of interconnection,” and

said the spaces they provided would do the same thing a quad does on a traditional college

campus — promote interaction.

<br><br>

“Before the University Center was built, The New School lacked such places for informal

sitting, or gathering, or working, the kind of spaces usually found in traditional campuses as

quadrangles or student centers,” added Lia Gartner, Vice President for Design, Construction and

Facilities Management at The New School.

<br><br>

Koop acknowledged that the reason for the prominent staircase in the entrance was to

“barely put demand on the elevators.” Gartner added that, at first, the elevators were only meant

to go to a couple of floors each and that because of the anticipated influx of students the building

was going to need 20 of them. But the success of the stairs — easily visible and attractive — has

put less of a demand on the elevators.

<br><br>

The large staircase landings on every floor are meant to be open and interactive spaces,

Gartner said. “[They] do not have walls and are not scheduled, that's what makes them ‘open’,”

Gartner said. Providing this open space for chance encounters and learning, and meetings and

discussions, was always an integral goal of the design process, she said.

<br><br>

Because space in New York City is a luxury, Gartner continued, a further intention of the

design was to take advantage of the open­plan aspects of the building by making them multi-
purposed. Thus the numerous areas that are furnished in different ways, sometimes with couches

and tables or laptop stations, all of them open to anyone at any time. The most elaborate of those

spaces, on the fifth floor, has large communal tables as well as couches and chairs that give the

place a more lounge­esque feel.

<br><br>

In fact, students don’t even use the space for impromptu meetings and discussions. Most

of the spaces on and around the fourth and fifth­floor landings seemed to be used for individual

study. On a recent visit the only group on the fifth floor consisted of two students. Adrienne Carillo

and Victoria Boya, Parsons freshmen studying Fashion and Communication Design.

<br><br>

“I come here on a regular basis, it’s chill and a good place to work as well,” Carillo said,

gesturing towards the large windows. “I like that it’s so open.”

<br><br>

Two Parsons Communication Design students studying on the fourth floor, Antoinette

Serami and Grace Min, said they sometimes used the fifth floor communal space to meet with

other students.

<br><br>

“It’s a good place to meet for a group project and talk,” Serami said. They both also

mentioned rooms in the library, which can be reserved, and the lunchroom as plausible social and

study spaces. The large majority of students though, were sitting alone with earphones in.

<br><br>

Julia St. Clara, a BaFa student studying photography and psychology, was not one of

them.

<br><br>

“I like the white noise,” she said, eating lunch and using her laptop at an individual table

on the fifth floor. “I come here anytime between my classes, to eat and study. I’m usually

working,”

<br><br>

Koop and Gartner both say that they have received positive feedback about the open­plan

design, and the University Center in general.

<br><br>

“It’s exciting to me,” Koop said. “Being an architect, you deal in a virtual environment, but

what you are trying to do is build a physical environment where people are engaging with each

other in a more seamless way.”
