		<h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About Sushi</h2>

		<p>Sushi is eaten around the world, cheaply and expensively. It can be found in mall food

courts in Illinois, train stations in Tokyo, on the beaches of California, on top of Columbus Circle

in Manhattan, and in the alley ways of Melbourne. At our own University Center cafeteria, where

students consume 300 to 500 rolls a day, sushi is one of the most popular items. But sushi is more

than a roll of raw fish and rice. Sushi is an entire world, wrapped into itself. And there is a lot you

don’t know about sushi.

<br><br>

Sushi was actually invented sometime around the 7th century in Southeast Asia, where it

was first used as a way to preserve raw fish in fermented rice, which was then thrown away.

<br><br>

This method of fish pickling spread in practice to southern China, until sometime around

the 15th century the Japanese finally caught wind, and decided they wanted to eat the rice as well.

In Japan sushi evolved from a method of preservation to a quick snack, often sold from street carts.

<br><br>

<br><br>

Sushi came to America by way of 1950’s California, where in a small section of L.A.

known as Little Tokyo, the California Roll began gaining in popularity.

<br><br>

Sushi in America remained a California craze for only a short time. In the 1960’s Japan’s

economy was thriving, and wealthy Japanese businessmen were travelling to L.A. and frequenting

the myriad of sushi restaurants that were popping up. By 1980’s Americans had grown in their

sushi consumption and were eating more fish as a healthy alternative to red meat, and the

restaurants began moving East. This increase in fish consumption also brought with it the rise of

industrial fishing, bycatch, and the depletion of many of the most popular fish populations.

<br><br>

The booming Japanese economy meant that across the Pacific, they were eating a ton of

sushi themselves, creating an import demand for tuna that rolled across the world and further

spread the globalization of sushi. America became a huge exporter of tuna. The popularity of tuna,

as well as the booming export trade, is one of the leading causes of the collapse of bluefin tuna

population, and a reason many sustainability advocates eye the sushi world warily.

<br><br>

Just as the American tuna export industry took off in the 1990’s, the Japanese economy

crashed. But by then, sushi had created a niche market for itself in North America, especially in its

cities. The United States was riding the sushi wave.

<br><br>


Sushi did not come from Japan, but there is a reason we identify it as Japanese. The sushi

we eat today, whether it is sashimi (raw) or in a roll (usually), is, at its best, prepared meticulously

and fresh, in the clean and precise style that reflects the minimalist aesthetic of Japanese culture.

<br><br>

Theodore Bestor is a professor of anthropology and Japanese studies at Harvard and an

author on many books and essays about the world of sushi and its globalization. In his essay “How

Sushi Went Global”, he writes how firm the Japanese grip remains on the world of sushi, from the

docks of New England where they instruct foreign fishermen on how to export tuna, to the

restaurants themselves, where the perceived prestige of Japan drives restaurant owners to maintain

a facade of Japanese culture.

<br><br>

There are sushi chefs across the world and around the United States who strive to maintain

Japan’s perfection, even when the chefs preparing the sushi are from China, Mexico, and Detroit.

There are chefs that serve only very traditionally, there are chefs that only serve raw, there are

omakase chefs (basically a tasting menu, omakase literally means “I’ll leave it to you).

<br><br>

But there is also sushi that has been commodified far beyond the point of traditional

preparation. There is the “fast food” sushi, of the ilk served in gas stations and Duane Reades. And

even Tokyo cannot be left out of this departure from “tradition”, as the founders of conveyor­belt

sushi, where customers sit at a bar and pick from sushi on plates on a moving conveyor belt in

front of them. And while sushi is one of the biggest sellers at the University Center, not everyone

is thrilled with how the sushi is prepared and presented. Aki Okoshi a Japanese student at Eugene

Lang, shares these criticisms.

<br><br>

“I'm interested why the cafeteria adapted western style sushi, it's very different from my

perspective I don't call that sushi, I would describe it as poorly imitated sushi"

<br><img src="chef1.jpg" alt="chef1" width="400" height="300" align="left" hspace="10"><br>

So between tradition and

appropriation, where does the

University Center cafeteria fit in?

<br><br>

Fabio Parasecoli is the

coordinator of Food Studies at the

New School. He also eats at the

University Center cafeteria about

once a week.

<br><br>

“I don’t believe in the

notion of authenticity,

authenticity is constructed and

contextual,” said Parasecoli.

“Sushi in Japan is not a frozen

tradition, it’s dynamic, it changes

with time. I think the desire in the

cafeteria is to reflect the

cosmopolitanism both of the university and of New York. In a way, it would feel out of place if

there was just one kind of food.

<br><br>

“It’s very important, especially for students. It is a way to explore other cultures and other

traditions. And it’s also a very controlled and domesticated experience because first of all you’re

having it in your cafeteria in New York, you’re not at Tsukiji in the middle of the night trying to

fight for some fish.”

<br><br>

on a dock in Maine, who is on the phone to see how tuna prices are doing at the Tsukiji fish

market. The Japanese bidder will load the fish, where it will make the drive from Maine to JFK

airport and fly to Tokyo only to be sold at the Tsukiji fish market the at 3 AM the next morning to

a wholesaler that markets to chefs in New York City. The tuna will fly back to JFK and will appear

on the plates of some cosmopolitan diners. Such is the influence of the Tsukiji fish market that it

determines the day to day livelihood of a fisherman in Maine. Such is the influence of Japan on

sushi.

A few blocks away from the

University Center, Sushi Nakazawa opened

on a quiet West Village street off of 7th

Avenue in August of 2014. The chef,

Daisuke Nakazawa, worked at the Tsukiji

fish market and was an apprentice for over

ten years to the renowned Jiro Ono, of Jiro

Dreams Of Sushi fame. To get a

reservation, one must be prepared to book

early, and even then it is nearly impossible

to get the date and time you want:

reservations open for 30 days in advance

every night at midnight, and fill up almost

immediately.

<br><br>

The restaurant is minimally decorated in black and white, with lushly padded chairs and

mirrors to make the narrow space seem larger. The only color comes from a large vase of flowers

in the back window, and a Subway sandwich bag leftover from service director Doug Hopkin’s

lunch on the sushi bar’s counter.

<br><br>

“Are you going to be taking pictures? I’ll need to change if you want to take pictures.” A

few minutes later Hopkins has changed into a suit and tie and is sitting by the window in the back.

<br><br>

Sushi Nakazawa is an omakase restaurant. Diners come, sit, and are served twenty courses

of sushi, prepared by the chef behind the bar. The fish is fresh, the service is impeccable, the wine

list is extensive. The bar omakase at Sushi Nakazawa costs $150.

<br><br>

So how do you compare $150 sushi at a luxe West Village restaurant to a $7 California roll served

in a cafeteria? Well, it turns out, you really can’t.

<br><br>

“You’re not doing anything wrong,” said Hopkins. “You’re talking about maki (rolls) and

we serve nigiri (raw fish on rice). They’re two different styles. But still, you’re above where it

started, with the street carts.”

<br><br>

“It’s very complicated because in many ways it is a form of cultural appropriation,” said

Parasecoli. “But at the same time it’s a mediation between the experience of the student and

different cultures.”

<br><br>

Giving students access to sushi serves as a gateway, and an accessible one at that. It

allowing a peek into Japanese culture that may be small, and is probably often overlooked when a

student is scarfing down a salmon roll in the hall between class. But perhaps it is serving the role

that sushi was always meant to have. Whatever that may be.
