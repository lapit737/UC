Going to college in Manhattan isn’t cheap, and The New School is no exception. Between the cost of living, transportation, art supplies, tuition, and paying for a thirteen-dollar salmon in the school’s cafeteria, the price adds up fast. <br><br>

“The accessibility of the food speaks to what it costs to attend the school in general, and how students can easily or cannot afford the costs,” said a student declining to give her name. <br><br>

Though the start of the financial strain put on students, comes from the incredibly high price of tuition. A price that continues to rise, even this year. <br><br>

Today The New School holds fifth place in USA Today’s ranking of the most expensive private universities by net price, which means the total cost of one year of undergraduate college education for a first time freshmen, though the high price of attending is nothing new. The New School was previously ranked the fourth most expensive college in the country by “CBS” in 2013, and continues to be placed in the top twenty most expensive colleges in the country each year. According to The New School the average student spends approximately $41,836 in tuition, a price which rose 7% this year according to the Registrar's Office, and fees plus an additional $18,190 for university room and board. <br><br>
For a school where 71% of the student body receives some type of financial aid in order to attend, and 43% of all incoming students to the school take out Federal loans their first year, talk of the economic struggles that students face day to day is rarely heard. You may even call the subject taboo. Many of the students asked to comment on this article were unwilling to talk about their financial struggles unless their names were omitted. <br><br>

When asked why they felt the need to remain anonymous, six students answered they were afraid to be judged or looked down upon by the people within the school, bringing to light the bigger issue of the role that money plays within the New School’s culture. <br><br>

“The culture (at TNS) in general emphasizes having money and showing it,” said a student who asked that her name not be used. <br><br>

Inside the cafeteria you can’t help but be bombarded by students covered in flashy designer logos. You won’t have to look far to find a student snacking on a $12.99 sushi roll with the latest Chanel bag hanging from their chair, or a student carrying their work in a Louis Vuitton backpack. For some students trying to fit in at The New School, it can be quite expensive. <br><br>

“I always have to have on something cute when I go to class, otherwise people look at you weird,” said a student declining to give her name. <br><br>

These economic issues are so prevalent within the school that a new group called CA$HCA$H (Community, Action & Support for Having Conversations About Socioeconomic Hierarchies) formed to help be the voice of those students struggling to keep up. In a recent article done by The New School Free Press about the group and the price of the school at large, the reporter visited one of CA$HCA$H’s first meetings at which one of its four leaders Sorcha Fatooh said “every student feels like the only poor student.” <br><br>

For some students, the price of attending the New School just became too high, and they were unable to continue studying at the University. <br><br>

“Though I no longer attend Parsons, when I first was accepted the only thought I had was how much debt will I leave this place with,” said Gabe Marrazzo 22 a former fine arts major, “I quickly added totals and checked many sources for loans and financial aid and found that toward the end of my stay at Parsons, I would be looking at nearly $300,000 TO $400,000 in debt.”  This number comes from paying the full cost of tuition, the prices of student loans, housing, commuting costs, and the increasing amounts of art supplies Parsons students need. <br><br>

“The New School itself is insanely expensive and it seems as if students who have to take out loans are more aware of how absurdly expensive it is,” said a student asking to remain anonymous. <br><br> 

Each year, The New School reports to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) the income level of all incoming first year undergraduates who file a Free Application For Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The data however, shows a larger low income percentage than high income. The statistics sent in for the year 2013 show that 37% of student families had an income below $30,000, and only 21% over $110,000. <br><br>

For some students scholarships are the only way they would be able to attend the university at all. “I wouldn’t even be in this school without my scholarship.” said Gabriela Corretjer, an Integrated Design sophomore at Parsons. <br><br>

With the prices of the university’s tuition already high, and continuing to rise, students will have to try and keep up with the race of affording the New School, its organic food, and snagging next season’s Prada backpack.
