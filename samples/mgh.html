<img src="mamanarwhal.png" alt="Mama Narwhal" style="width:300px;height:250px" align='left'hspace='10'><br>Diane Yee, The New School’s athletic director, can be seen pacing the sidelines of the Narwhals’ basketball games and

soccer matches. She has a camera in hand, documenting her hard work. Sometimes her short black hair is in a

ponytail, sometimes it falls straight to her shoulders. She usually has some sort of Narwhal athletic gear on, a

movement she’s spearheaded. She’s created Narwhal shirts, socks, scarves, hats, sweatpants. She doesn’t always

cheer for the Narwhals during games. She stays cool. She’s about results.

<br><br>

“Diane’s on a mission,” basketball team manager and student­worker Blair Reeves said. Reeves has worked for Yee for

the past three years and has seen athletics flourish under Yee. “She’s on a mission to fill the void of athletics at The

New School. She is one of the few people at this university that actually listens to the students and provides them with

fitness classes, outdoor trips and varsity sports teams,” Reeves said. Reeves, along with her coworkers, have started

calling their boss “Mama Narwhal.”

<br><br>

Yee came to The New School in August, 2012. She graduated from The College of New Jersey, an NCAA Division III

school, where she says her love for athletics grew.

<br><br>

“[I] was able to participate year­round in intramurals [in college], and I played club volleyball, I helped with the varsity

football program. I was extremely interested in athletics and recreation, not only to participate, but to assist as a student

manager, and also they paid student employees of the department,” Yee said.

<br><br>

“So I wanna be able to bring that to other students, so that is works for them. Not only for social exercise, but for fitness,

and just as a stress relief,” Yee said.

<br><br>

When Yee first got to The New School, she worked closely with the basketball team, which was in place for a few years.

She’s already seen results.

<br><br>

“In the two years I’ve been here, our opponents have been kind of in awe of what we’ve done in a short amount of time.

I’ve become good friends with the people at Pratt, and Dean Baker over at Cooper. And they really applaud our work

and out students and how far we’ve come,” Yee said.

<br><br>

While wins haven’t been easy to come by in the past few years for the basketball team, this year the Narwhals are off to

a 3­0 start. The soccer team took the Village’s Cup after beating Cooper Union in October. The cross country team

enjoyed great success this Fall, with the women’s team placing third in a race in September and grad student MacLean

O’Donnell tearing through three races for the men.

<br><br>

Casey Barber played for the Narwhals basketball team for a year and has worked for Yee since she was a freshman.

“Diane is extremely involved and a passionate leader,” Barber said. “And her work is reflected in the massive growth of

athletics and recreation of The New School each year.”

<br><br>

That massive growth can be seen in the ever­expanding intramurals for the school. Students can participate in

basketball, volleyball, dodgeball and soccer. Yee’s Athletic and Recreation Office offers even more.

<br><br>

“We have an outdoor adventures program. Every weekend we’re running multiple trips and every single trip we have a

new student who has never done anything through our program before,” Yee said.

<br><br>

“So we’re still constantly getting new students in the program and learning about what we do. And once we get them in

one location, they’ll learn about everything else,” Yee continued. “If they come out to yoga for the first time or self-
defense class, then they also start learning about intramurals, and our outdoor adventures program, and that we have

athletics. So it’s really coming together.”

<br><br>

“You can tell she really cares about the department because she puts her heart into every event and program,”

Carly McDougald, one of Yee’s workers, said. “I get emails from her at, like, 3 AM about getting a flyer started or

promoting an event on our social media which just goes to show she’s always thinking about giving more to the

students and her brainstorming runs on a 24­hour clock.”

<br><br>

Yee, however, does recognize the need to legitimize the program and has ideas about facilities that could help

The New School’s growing athletic presence. Right now, the only dedicated space that New School athletes don’t have

to pay to use is a one­room studio on the eighth floor of 80 Fifth Avenue. There are a few free weights and room for

stretching, with a mirror. Other than that, The New School either rents space or uses Manhattan’s streets and parks to

train.

<br><br>

“We’re still looking for committed facilities and practice space,” Yee said. “I think that’s one, is to know that

we’re safe with space. For example basketball has been playing for years at Washington Irving High School, but this

upcoming spring we don’t even know if we are gonna get the gym back! So just making sure we have committed

practice space close to campus is a big part of ‘next steps’.”

<br><br>

There’s no word yet on whether or not the basketball team will be able to maintain their practice space.

Michael Joy is Director of Campus Planning at The New School. He went to The Catholic University of

America, an NCAA Division III school in Washington, DC, with multiple dedicated athletic facilities. When asked about

previous plans to build a basketball court in The New School’s University Center, Joy said he hadn’t heard anything

about that.

<br><br>

“I’m trying to think of all the old documents I’ve seen,” Joy said. “I’ve never seen one that has a gym. I’ve never

seen anything (about a gym) and I've seen some of the older stuff,” Joy continued. “It did go through a series of re­

designs, it was a much larger building at one point and it was not well received by the neighbors, so it was kind of

scaled back.”

<br><br>

“I would love to have a court on campus, that could be used for basketball, volleyball, soccer, and tennis,” Yee

continued. “But that’s something we would need to apply a whole new building for. I would love one dedicated space,

that all students could utilize. Obviously it would be a lot of square footage but I think we could start small and expand it.

I would have a full weight room, with treadmills and ellipticals for cardio, also a proper set of free weights, and a proper

set of plate lifting machines. I have always imagined building a gym that could accommodate everything we (athletics)

have, but it would have to outfitted with a complete fitness room, maybe even a cycling corner or cycling studio... but,

you know, that takes space, and money.”

<br><br>

Linda Reimer, Senior Vice President for Student Services at The New School, wouldn’t disclose the athletics

budget.

<br><br>

“When resources are requested, the leadership of the university has to prioritize, since the pool of resources is

not big enough to accommodate everything everybody wants,” Reimer said. “The President (David Van Zant) and

Provost (Tim Marshall) are using the current strategic plan to determine those priorities.”

<br><br>

Reimer wouldn’t go in­depth about the strategic plan, but she did compliment Yee.

<br><br>

“Compare before 2012 to where we are now. Sometimes you can make huge improvements with the same

resources by using creativity and finding efficiencies,” Reimer said.

<br><br>

“A big part of bringing a gym on campus, is that it gives so many students opportunities for employment,” Yee

said. “I know there’s a ton of students that are granted with student funds, and never utilize them cause they don’t know

hot to find a job. And by opening a gym, that’s open to all students it creates jobs; just monitoring, maintenance, and

upkeep. So that’s another reason why having fitness on campus is beneficial for the students.”

<br><br>

After each Narwhal victory, becoming more common in all six Narwhal teams, Yee’s hard work pays off a little

more. She’s getting results.

	Mark Spathas, a senior at Lang, has played for the soccer and basketball teams in his two years at The New School. In 2013-14, Spathas won the Most Improved Player award for the basketball team. In Fall 2014, Spathas played a key role in winning the first ever Village Cup, as a starter on the soccer team that outlasted Cooper Union to take the first-ever athletic trophy back to The New School.
	Spathas, from San Diego, witnessed the start of the soccer team. <br><br>
	“The soccer team began as a bunch of New School soccer fans showing up to a public space looking for some outlet for organized play. We met every Saturday, and gradually we got more momentum with more and more people hearing about it and showing up,” Spathas said. <br><br>
	<img src="mark2.png" alt="Mark2" style="width:350px;height:200px" align='right'><br>
	“We were fortunate to find a grad student, [soccer team head coach] Javi Carpenter, who was willing to dedicate some of his time and expertise, which really gave us a bit more structure and fused the gap from what was once the grassroots, student-initiated organization, to the athletic department here at New School,” Spathas said. <br><br>
	Spathas said his athletic life before coming to The New School was “pretty casual,” but he does recognize the need for athletic facilities for the Narwhals. <br><br>
	“[T]he reality of it is, without dedicated space to The New School sports programs, it becomes difficult to maintain momentum,” Spathas said. <br><br>
	“The soccer team was often fighting for public space, which, especially in the early days--every New York City minute wasted searching for space to practice further distinguished the feeling of disconnection between being a New School Student and being a New School Athlete. That gap is what causes development to plateau, as student- athletes need to feel supported by the school itself. This is what would take something grass- roots and student run past the realm of being extracurricular and into a more developed integrated athletic program.” <br>

		“I’ve had a blast on the running team. I wish it wasn’t over.” - MacLean O’Donnell <br><br>

	MacLean O’Donnell is a grad student at Parsons studying Fashion Design. The Oak Ridge, TN native, took a year off after graduating from Texas A&M with an undergrad degree in Business. He also ran NCAA Division I track at A&M and in the three races he ran at The New School this fall, he won easily. <br><br>
	O’Donnell said he had a great time as a Narwhal, but that it’s tough to compare to his time at A&M. <br><br><img src="ml2.png" alt="MO" style="width:230px;height:330px" align='right'>
	“At Texas A&M I was in a fully funded Division I athletic department so I had every single resource available for an athlete, as well as a scholarship, a dedicated academic center for the athletes,” O’Donnell said. <br><br>
	“At The New School it’s completely different. The atmosphere is much more tight knit and laid back. It is a small community.” After taking a year off from running, O’Donnell said being a Narwhal helped him adjust to New York and The New School. <br><br>
	O’Donnell said he’s in New York to go to school, so the lack of athletic facilities doesn’t bother him too much, but he also said he thinks “the idea of more facilities is great.” <br><br>
	“Students and athletes would only benefit from more facilities,” O’Donnell said. “The reality though, here at The New School, is that the athletic department is small and for the most part, for the students to have fun. There is no real necessity for dedicated athletic facilities. If there is a strong possibility of growth for the athletic department to join an athletic association such as the NCAA and get fully funded teams with scholarships, I think that new athletic facilities is a must.” <br>
