Activism In the New School: Comfort versus Confrontation

Reggae reverberated off the walls of the Social Justice Hub as the Students for Justice in Palestine

club set up tables and chairs for their discourse on Israel­Palestine conflicts. A two hour conversation on the

history of the conflict ensued. Conversations, discourses, and talks are common in this area on the fifth

floor, but some worry that the Hub is all talk and no action.

<br><br>

With the creation of a Social Justice Hub activist hoped that there would be a concrete

space for these activities but some believe that the Hub has not helped to promote greater social

activism at the university.

<br><br>

“We used to be known as the Marxists of the village, we were so hardcore into what we

were doing,” said Petra Jarrar, 17­year­old sophomore at Lang and one of three students in The

Social Justice Committee. “Nowadays I feel like it’s gotten a lot weaker.”

<br><br>

In reaction to the student protests of 2009 and 2011 The New School’s Social Justice Committee

(Students and faculty members), the then­director of Social Justice Initiatives Sydney Kopp­Richardson,

Provost Tim Marshall and President David Van Zandt agreed that there was a need for an area

dedicated to social justice in the newly finished University Center building. The Hub gave the

Social Justice Committee and the groups associated with it a place of their own. Some now worry

that with this designated area the activists of the school have lost the initiative to go out and

actually act.

<br><br>

“They wanted a type of multifunctioning space that they could identify as a home

base, where they could meet­up to do programming or be with like­minded people,” said Michael

Joy, the Director of Campus Planning who helped define the purpose of different spaces and

facilities at the University Center.

<br><br>

The Social Justice Committee includes students, faculty, staff, and administrators from

several divisions who work with the Provost’s office to address socioeconomic and cultural

divisions of identity through policy and action. When the proposed University Center’s layout was

shown to the student body at a 2012 town hall, the committee asked President David Van Zandt for

a space for the committee and the student clubs under its umbrella. They wanted a place that was

specifically their own. The result was the Social Justice Hub.

<br><br>

Joy explained that after the 2011 protests it became apparent to Provost Tim

Marshall and President Van Zandt that there was “an extreme need for the university to create a

place for social action.”

<br><br>

Students have used the city and the urban campus as a place to organize for social

justice activism for decades. Whether it was sit­ins and an art show protesting the Vietnam War in

the sixties or a school wide protest against a racist painting in 1988, students were active in social

justice long before the Hub.

<br><br>

As recently as in the last ten years, student activism at the New School has made national

headlines. At the 2006 New School graduation ceremony, the student speaker Jean Sara Rohe used her

time on the podium to protest the decision to have Republican Senator John McCain give the

commencement address. In her speech she confronted the Arizona senator for his support of the Iraq War by

saying: “the senator does not reflect the ideals upon which this university was founded.”

<br><br>

Three years later a group of students broke into the construction site for the New School’s

University Center to protest against lack of student involvement in tuition and investment

decisions. They chose to call themselves “the University in Exile” also the former name of the

New School in the 1930s. From 2009 to 2011 the New School community organized four

occupations of university buildings in protest of economic issues, student debt, and the school’s

investments in fossil fuels. All four times the specter of the school’s history of dissent and

progressivism was used as a call for action.

<br><br>

A year after the Hub’s opening the social justice activist community has had a couple

protests on campus including a sit­in at the Lang courtyard attended by about 30 activists and a

teach­in with many of the same people in the Hub both about police brutality and racism.

<br><br>

Many of the activist work done by those who use the Hub has focused on creating a

safe space where club members can talk about what bothers them without the intrusion of

outsiders.

<br><br>

“I was actually planning this year to really focus my efforts and my energy on

activism outside of this school,” said Tsige Tafesse, a leader in the student activist community,

“but I feel there is such a lacking of university support for students of color, queer students, low-
income students, just across the board. The university doesn’t help to create safe spaces for these

bodies and identities.”

<br><br>

Tafesse’s outlook on social justice comes from the belief that some students do not

have a place to feel comfortable in the school. At the Hub the Social Justice community hopes to

find comfort and security. Some fear that with comfort, the attention and action of confrontational

can be lost.

<br><br>

“They talk more than they do there is a lot of talk and no action,” said Jarrar about the Social

Justice Committee’s projects. One of the committee’s projects has been in progress for a year and a half, she

said, this kind of inaction is characteristic of the committee. “It is definitely enough time to bring some kind

of change so you would think something would have happened by now.”

<br><br>

“I don’t really think the inaction honors the social justice hub,” said Jarrar, “they always talk about

doing things in the future and making things continually happen but it’s not happening, it’s sad.”

<br><br>

Cecilia Frescas­Ortiz a senior at Eugene Lang and Leader of The New School Dream Team,

which meets every Tuesday at the Hub, believes that the hub should be more private. She said that she is

grateful there is a space intended for organizing and community building for social justice, but she finds the

location of the space a major impediment for active conversation about sensitive issues.

<br><br>

“It doesn't feel like this place is a social justice space, it feels like it’s an extension from the study

area,” said Frescas­Ortiz.

<br><br>

It is not only members who have had issues with the Hub. Two graduate fashion design classes neighboring

the hub have now switched classrooms to no longer be next to the Hub. The classes complained that there

was too much noise coming from the events hosted at the Hub.
